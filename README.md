## The Story Behind Weblyft
Imagine a world where deploying your applications is effortless, where infrastructure is no longer a bottleneck, and where cloud providers don‚Äôt dictate how you scale. Weblyft was born out of curiosity ‚Äî an exploration fueled by the vast array of free-tier services available from different cloud providers worldwide.

As students, we all relied on these free resources to learn and grow, experimenting with new technologies and expanding our knowledge. Over time, our curiosity grew: **How do these platforms really work under the hood? The best way to learn was to build it ourselves.**

Weblyft is not just a project‚Äîit‚Äôs a journey of discovery. It showcases how developers can deploy, manage, and scale applications using freely available tools, while gaining hands-on experience with modern deployment architectures. Whether you're a student, a startup, or a tech enthusiast, Weblyft is an invitation to explore the foundations of cloud computing and build something truly your own.
